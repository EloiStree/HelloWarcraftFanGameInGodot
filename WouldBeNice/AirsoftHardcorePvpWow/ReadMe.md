While watching his video where they try to find a way to create a wow that is horizontal on it expension evolution.

I have an idea of a fan game to try as private server of World of Warcraft:
- Xp multiply by 800 percent
- When you die 
  - all your inventory is lost
  - gear on the champion is lost
  - you respawn to Capital City
- You have a war armory at entrance of capital city when you can choose all different kind of weapons but crappy for free.
  - In case you want to "paysan loop" fight as a PVP war raid context
- In the concept of https://ingress.com/en you can capture zone for the horde or the alliance.
  - Capture zone give free resource every N hours to the faction and to the player on the zone when captured per mail box.
  - The guild with the most player killed when capturing a zone become it news temporal land lord with resources bonus.

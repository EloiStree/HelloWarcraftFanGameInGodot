# Hello Warcraft Fan Game In Godot

Let's explore the possibility of making fan game of Warcraft in Godot with Wow Export.

I want to teach code in Godot to kids and young adult but for that we need 3D assets.

I think that teaching how to make game from the Wow Export is a good idea (out of the legality to do it) because it give all the basic:
3D Model, Atlas, Animation, Character, Texturing ...

Allowing to focus on code and not asset production.

So in this git, I am going to explore the fesability of make some small fan game using Wow Export in Godot.

---------------
 
All credit to World of Warcraft on the assets.  
All mini game done in this repoistory are fan game and can't be shared or published.  
They are for you own use.  

Fan game and fan video has always be a hard topic in the community.
Some time allowed, some time promoted, sometime ban... Depending of the decade and the copyright owner.
